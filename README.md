# Tumor image classification

Classification of cancerous tissues in cells using Keras.

## Dataset

The dataset contains 2 classes of tumor images.  It was an imbalanced dataset. The number of images in class 2 (images with tumor) was about half of the number of class 1(images without tumor). Hence performed data augmentation to balance the data.

Image classification was performed using simple CNN model and deeper CNN model.
